# How to run the Android sample app

This guide demonstrates how to run an Android sample application that showcases sign up, sign in, sign out and reset password scenarios using Microsoft Entra External ID for customers.

In this article, you learn how to:

- Register application in the Microsoft Entra External ID for customers tenant.
- Enable public client flow.
- Create a sign-in and sign-out user flow in the Microsoft Entra External ID for customers tenant.
- Associate your application with the user flow.
- Edit the Android configuration code sample file to use your own Microsoft Entra External ID for customer tenant details.
- Run and test the sample native Android Kotlin mobile application.

## Prerequisites

- <a href="https://developer.android.com/studio/archive" target="_blank">Android Studio Dolphin | 2021.3.1 Patch 1</a>
- <a href="https://docs.github.com/en/authentication/keeping-your-account-and-data-secure/managing-your-personal-access-tokens#creating-a-personal-access-token-classic" target="_blank">Create a GitHub personal access token (classic)</a>. Ensure that you select the **read:packages** under **write:packages** scopes for the token. Make sure to copy your personal access token. You wonâ€™t be able to see it again!
- Microsoft Entra External ID for customers tenant. If you don't already have one, <a href="https://aka.ms/ciam-free-trial?wt.mc_id=ciamcustomertenantfreetrial_linkclick_content_cnl" target="_blank">sign up for a free trial</a>.

This may take up to 7 days. Alternatively, you can request a pre-created tenant from us that has been allowlisted using the same form.

## Register an application

To enable your application to sign in users with Microsoft Entra, Microsoft Entra External ID for customers must be made aware of the application you create. The app registration establishes a trust relationship between the app and Microsoft Entra. When you register an application, Microsoft Entra External ID generates a unique identifier known as an **Application (client) ID**, a value used to identify your app when creating authentication requests.

The following steps show you how to register your app in the Microsoft Entra admin center:

1. Sign in to the <a href="https://entra.microsoft.com/" target="_blank">Microsoft Entra admin center</a>.
1. If you have access to multiple tenants, make sure you use the directory that contains your Microsoft Entra External ID for customers tenant:

    1. Select the **Directories + subscriptions** icon <img type="icon" src="./ReadmeFiles/portal-directory-subscription-filter.png"> in the toolbar.
    1. On the **Portal settings | Directories + subscriptions** page, find your Microsoft Entra External ID for customers directory in the **Directory name** list, and then select **Switch**.

1. On the sidebar menu, select **Identity**.
1. Select **Applications** > **App Registrations**.
1. Select **+ New registration**.
1. In the **Register an application** page that appears;

    1. Enter a meaningful application **Name** that will be displayed to users of the app, for example _ciam-client-app_.
    1. Under **Supported account types**, select **Accounts in this organizational directory only**.

1. Select **Register**.
1. The application's **Overview** pane will display upon successful registration. Record the **Directory (tenant) ID** and the **Application (client) ID** to be used in your application source code.

## Enable public client flow

To specify that this app is a public client, enable public client flow:

1. Under **Manage**, select **Authentication**.
1. Under **Advanced settings**, for **Enable the following mobile and desktop flows**, select **Yes**.
1. Select **Save** button.

## Grant API permissions

1. From the **App registrations** page, select the application that you created (such as _ciam-client-app_) to open its **Overview** page.
1. Under **Manage**, select **API permissions**.
1. Under **Configured permissions**, select **Add a permission**.
1. Select **Microsoft APIs** tab.
1. Under **Commonly used Microsoft APIs** section, select **Microsoft Graph**.
1. Select **Delegated permissions** option.
1. Under **Select permissions** section, search for and select **offline_access**, **openid**, and **profile** permissions.
1. Select the **Add permissions** button.
1. At this point, you've assigned the permissions correctly. However, since the tenant is a customer's tenant, the consumer users themselves can't consent to these permissions. You as the admin must consent to these permissions on behalf of all the users in the tenant:

    1. Select **Grant admin consent for <your tenant name>**, then select **Yes**.
    2. Select **Refresh**, then verify that **Granted for<your tenant name>** appears under **Status** for both scopes.

## Create a user flow

Follow these steps to create a user flow.

1. Sign in to the <a href="https://entra.microsoft.com/" target="_blank">Microsoft Entra admin center</a>.
1. If you have access to multiple tenants, make sure you use the directory that contains your Microsoft Entra External ID for customers tenant:

    1. Select the **Directories + subscriptions** icon in the toolbar.
    1. On the **Portal settings | Directories + subscriptions** page, find your Microsoft Entra External ID for customers directory in the **Directory name** list, and then select **Switch**.

1. On the sidebar menu, select **Identity**.
1. Select **External Identities** > **User flows**.
1. Select **+ New user flow**.
1. On the **Create** page:

    1. Enter a **Name** for the user flow, such as _SignInSignUpSample_.
    1. In the **Identity providers** list, select **Email Accounts**. This identity provider allows users to sign-in or sign-up using their email address.
    1. Under **Email accounts**, you can select one of the two options. For this tutorial, select **Email one-time passcode**.

        - **Email with password**: Allows new users to sign up and sign in using an email address as the sign-in name and a password as their first factor credential.
        - **Email one-time passcode**: Allows new users to sign up and sign in using an email address as the sign-in name and email one-time passcode as their first factor credential.

          > [!NOTE]
          > Email one-time passcode must be enabled at the tenant level (**All Identity Providers** > **Email One-time-passcode**) for this option to be available at the user flow level.

    1. Under **User attributes**, you can choose the attributes you want to collect from the user upon sign-up. For this guide select **Country/Region** and **City**.
    1. Select **OK**. (Users can be prompted for attributes when they sign up for the first time)

1. Select **Create**. The new user flow appears in the **User flows** list. If necessary, refresh the page.

## Associate the  app with the user flow

Although many applications can be associated with your user flow, a single application can only be associated with one user flow.

To associate your user flow with your app, follow these steps.

1. On the sidebar menu, select **Identity**.
1. Select **External Identities**, then **User flows**.
1. In the **User flows** page, select the **User flow name** you created earlier, for example, _SignInSignUpSample_.
1. Under **Use**, select **Applications**.
1. Select **Add application**.
1. Select the application from the list such as _ciam-client-app_ or use the search box to find the application, and then select it.

1. Choose **Select**.

## Clone sample Android mobile application

1. Open Terminal and navigate to a directory where you want to keep the code.
1. Clone the application from GitHub by running the following command:

   ```bash 
   git clone https://github.com/AzureAD/msal-android-native-auth-sample-app-preview.git 
   ``` 

## Configure the sample Android mobile application

1. In Android Studio, open the project that you cloned.
1. Add the following reference for GitHub credentials to your global `gradle.properties`.

    ```gradle 
    GITHUB_USERNAME="<username>" 
    GITHUB_TOKEN="<generated-token>" 
    ``` 

   The default location of this global `gradle.properties` is:

    - `~/.gradle/gradle.properties (OSX)`
    - `C:\Users\<USER_NAME>\.gradle\gradle.properties (Windows)`

1. In the global `gradle.properties`, find the placeholder:

    1. `<username>` and replace it with your GitHub username.
    1. `<generated-token>` and replace it with your GitHub personal access token.

   After configuring these values in your global `gradle.properties`, you might need to restart your environment (restart Terminal, Android Studio, or the entire machine).

   > **_NOTE:_**  In order to import the MSAL and MSAL common libraries during the private preview, you will need GitHub personal access token.

1. Open `app/src/main/res/raw/native_auth_sample_app_config.json` file.
1. Find the placeholder:

    1. `Enter_the_Application_Id_Here` and replace it with the **Application (client) ID** of the app you registered earlier.
    1. `Enter_the_Tenant_Subdomain_Here` and replace it with the Directory (tenant) subdomain. For example, if your tenant primary domain is `contoso.onmicrosoft.com`, use contoso. If you don't have your tenant name, learn how to [read your tenant details](https://learn.microsoft.com/azure/active-directory/external-identities/customers/how-to-create-customer-tenant-portal#get-the-customer-tenant-details).

1. Select **File** > **Sync Project with Gradle Files**.

## Run and test sample Android mobile application

To build and run your app, follow these steps:

1. In the toolbar, select your app from the run configurations menu.
1. In the target device menu, select the device that you want to run your app on.

   If you don't have any devices configured, you need to either create an Android Virtual Device to use the Android Emulator or connect a physical device.

1. Select **Run** button.

1. The app will open on the email and one-time passcode screen.

    <img width="343" src="./ReadmeFiles/android-email-otp.png"> 

1. Enter a valid email address and select **Sign up**. The app will launch submit code screen.

    <img width="343" src="./ReadmeFiles/android-submit-code.png"> 

1. You'll receive an email containing a one-time passcode. Enter the one-time passcode and select **Next**. If the sign-up was successful, you will automatically be signed in.

    <img width="343" src="./ReadmeFiles/android-sign-in-account-display.png"> 

1. Select **Sign out** to clear the signed in account from the cache. After signing out, the application will allow a new user to sign up or sign in.

### Other flows

The sample app supports the following flows:

1. _Email + OTP_: Follow this flow to sign in or sign up with an email and a one-time passcode.
1. _Email + password_: Follow this flow to sign in or sign up with an email, password and one-time passcode.
1. _Email + password sign up with user attributes_: Follow this flow to sign up with email, password and user attributes.
1. _Password reset_: Follow this flow to reset the password.
1. _Fallback to web browser_: Follow this flow to use the browser to sign in or sign up.

> **_NOTE:_** In the [Create a user flow](#create-a-user-flow) section, you created a user flow where you chose **Email one-time passcode** under **Identity providers > Email Accounts**. For flows 2 through 4, you require a user flow that uses **Email with password** under **Identity providers > Email Accounts**.

Follow the steps in [Create a user flow](#create-a-user-flow) to create a user flow that uses **Email with password** under **Identity providers > Email Accounts**. Remember to [associate the application with the new user flow](#associate-the-android-app-with-the-user-flow).

After linking your application with the new user flow, run the application and use the bottom navigation to select different flows for testing.
